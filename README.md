Hello! I'm Piotr, a junior full stack web developer. With a passion for creating dynamic and engaging web applications, I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.

I have experience working with a range of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express JS, Typescript, MongoDB . I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end development and am comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality results.

In my free time, I love tinkering with new technologies and experimenting with different web development techniques. If you're looking for a dedicated and motivated team member who's ready to jump in and start contributing from day one, I'd love to connect!
