I have experience working with a range of programming languages and technologies as seen below.
I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end development and am comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality results.

In my free time, I love tinkering with new technologies and experimenting with different web development techniques. If you're looking for a dedicated and motivated team member who's ready to jump in and start contributing from day one, I'd love to connect!
